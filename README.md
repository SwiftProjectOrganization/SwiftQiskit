# SwiftQiskit 

**SwiftQiskit** is a lightweight **quantum computing simulator** written entirely in **Swift**.  
It brings a **Qiskit-like experience** to the Apple ecosystem, with a strong focus on **clarity**, **correctness**, and **future GUI integration**.

>  This project is **experimental and educational**, but grounded in real quantum mechanics principles

Differences between this forked repository ("**fork**") and its parent are:
1. The usage of Xcode playgrounds
2. Showing of Bloch spheres (in live playgrounds)
3. Using Swift Testing.

##  Design Philosophy

* No hidden magic — everything is **explicit and readable**
* Mathematical correctness over shortcuts
* Modular architecture (**Core / Examples / GUI-ready**)
* Designed for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **extension**

---

##  Final Note

**SwiftQiskit** is not just a simulator —

##  Getting Started with this fork

### Requirements

* Swift **6.3+**
* macOS **27+**
- Xcode 27.0  

This forked repository is developed using Swift 6.3+ and MacOS 27.0-beta

---

### Clone the Repository

Open Xcode, go to `Integrate` and clone "https://github.com/SwiftProjectOrganization/SwiftQiskit".

### Run the Bell State Example

```bash
swift run SwiftQiskitExamples
```

Note: This will not work yet in Xcode 27.0-beta, please use playground 01BellExample for now.

---

## 🔗 Bell State Example (Entanglement)

The Bell state **|Φ⁺⟩** is defined as:

```
|Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2
```

### Code Example

```swift
import SwiftQiskitCore

let circuit = QuantumCircuit(qubits: 2)

circuit.h(0)
circuit.apply(CNOTGate.matrix)

let finalState = circuit.run()
print(finalState)

for _ in 0..<10 {
    let result = circuit.runAndMeasure()
    print(result)
}
```
> Note: The core module is currently imported as `SwiftQiskitCore`.

### Expected Measurement Output

```text
00
11
00
11
11
00
```

>  States **01** and **10** never appear —
> this confirms **quantum entanglement**.
> Measurement outputs are probabilistic and may vary per run.

##  Playgrounds

`Playgrounds.playground` (at the repo root, macOS target) contains interactive, lecture-style
explorations of the library. Open it in Xcode — pages build against the `SwiftQiskit` scheme
and are linked sequentially with Previous/Next markers.

Code shared by multiple pages (the Bloch-sphere types and views) lives in the playground's
`Sources/` folder — see [PLAYGROUNDSUPPORT.md](PLAYGROUNDSUPPORT.md) for how that works and
what is available.

### 01BellExample

Annotated walkthrough of the Bell state |Φ⁺⟩: builds the circuit (`h` + `cx`), inspects the
resulting state vector and its amplitudes/probabilities, and runs a 1000-shot measurement.

### 02Lecture_01

Minimal Bell-state circuit: run, print amplitudes, and measure 1024 shots.

### 03Lecture_03

Introduces `StateVector` directly and its `probabilities` property.

### 04Lecture_04

Building custom gates from raw `Matrix`/`Complex` values (Identity and a hand-rolled Pauli-X)
and applying them via `circuit.apply(_:)`.

### 05BlochSphere

Visualizes single-qubit states on the **Bloch sphere** using a SwiftUI `Canvas` live view.

- **Bloch vector math** — maps a state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ to sphere coordinates
  (x = 2·Re(ᾱβ), y = 2·Im(ᾱβ), z = |α|² − |β|²) plus the spherical angles θ and φ,
  reusing the `Complex` arithmetic from `SwiftQiskitCore`.
- **Rendering** — a 2D orthographic projection of the sphere with axes, drawn by the
  shared `BlochSphereView`, each sphere accompanied by a numeric readout.
- **Gallery** — four canonical states built with real circuits and shown side by side:
  |0⟩ (north pole), |1⟩ via Pauli-X (south pole), |+⟩ via Hadamard (+x axis), and
  |−⟩ via Hadamard + Pauli-Z (−x axis). The same vectors are also printed to the console.

### 06BlochSphere_02

A *general* single-qubit state, tilted off the equator of the Bloch sphere (45° from x,
60° from y and z), explored in depth.

- **Ket definition** — derives |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ}·sin(θ/2)|1⟩ from direction
  cosines and builds the state directly from its amplitudes with `StateVector`.
- **Console readout** — amplitudes, magnitudes, probabilities, and a round-trip check
  recovering the Bloch vector from the amplitudes.
- **Live view** — the state on a large Bloch sphere plus two **plane projections**
  (x–y seen from +z, z–y seen from +x) drawn by the shared `BlochProjectionView`.

### 07BlochSphere3D

An **interactive 3D Bloch sphere**: a rotatable wireframe rendered with a pure SwiftUI
`Canvas` (no SceneKit/RealityKit), plus live sliders for the spherical angles.

- **3D rendering** — latitude/longitude circles are perspective-projected through an
  orbit camera; drag the canvas to rotate. The far hemisphere is drawn dimmer as a
  depth cue, and dashed drop lines connect the state vector to the equator plane.
- **θ/φ sliders** — rebuild |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^{iφ}·sin(θ/2)|1⟩ on every change.
  The two sliders are independent because the parametrization keeps
  |α|² + |β|² = cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) = 1 identically — every slider position is a
  valid normalized state, shown live in the numeric readout.
- **Xcode 27 beta note** — running SwiftUI playground pages on the Xcode 27 beta
  currently needs two workarounds, described in
  [PLAYGROUNDSUPPORT.md](PLAYGROUNDSUPPORT.md#xcode-27-beta-workarounds): a shim
  `libcups.dylib` in DerivedData, and keeping `@State`-based views in the playground's
  `Sources/` folder (which is why the slider view `BlochExplorerView` lives there).

The Bloch types and views (`BlochVector`, `BlochSphereView`, `BlochProjectionView`,
`Bloch3DView`, `BlochExplorerView`) are shared between these pages via the playground's
`Sources/` folder (not part of Core) — see [PLAYGROUNDSUPPORT.md](PLAYGROUNDSUPPORT.md).
