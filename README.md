# SwiftQiskit 

**SwiftQiskit** is a lightweight **quantum computing simulator** written entirely in **Swift**.  
It brings a **Qiskit-like experience** to the Apple ecosystem, with a strong focus on **clarity**, **correctness**, and **future GUI integration**.

>  This project is **experimental and educational**, but grounded in real quantum mechanics principles

> The main difference between this repository and it's parent is the usage of Xcode playgounds.

##  Getting Started

### Requirements

* Swift **5.9+**
* macOS **13+**
  *(iOS 16+ planned for future UI integration)*

---

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/a360n/SwiftQiskit.git
cd SwiftQiskit
```

### Run the Bell State Example

```bash
swift run SwiftQiskitExamples
```

---

## 🔗 Bell State Example (Entanglement)

The Bell state **|Φ⁺⟩** is defined as:

```
|Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩) / √2
```

### Code Example

```swift
import SwiftQiskitCore

let circuit = QuantumCircuit(qubits: 2)

circuit.h(0)
circuit.apply(CNOTGate.matrix)

let finalState = circuit.run()
print(finalState)

for _ in 0..<10 {
    let result = circuit.runAndMeasure()
    print(result)
}
```
> Note: The core module is currently imported as `SwiftQiskitCore`.

### Expected Measurement Output

```text
00
11
00
11
11
00
```

>  States **01** and **10** never appear —
> this confirms **quantum entanglement**.
> Measurement outputs are probabilistic and may vary per run.

##  Design Philosophy

* No hidden magic — everything is **explicit and readable**
* Mathematical correctness over shortcuts
* Modular architecture (**Core / Examples / GUI-ready**)
* Designed for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **extension**

##  Contributing

Contributions, ideas, and discussions are welcome.
This project is built **step by step** and open for exploration.

##  Project Status

 **SwiftQiskit is currently in an early experimental stage (v0.1).**

- Core quantum simulation is implemented
- API is subject to change
- Performance is not yet optimized
- GUI tools are optional and under development

The project is actively evolving, and major features are planned.
---
## ✅ What Works (v0.1)

- QuantumCircuit abstraction
- Single-qubit gates: H, X, Z
- Two-qubit entanglement (CNOT – limited v0.1)
- StateVector simulation
- Measurement with shots & counts
- Bell State example
- Unit tests for correctness
---
##  Roadmap

- [ ] General multi-qubit CNOT support
- [ ] Additional gates (Y, Phase, Rotation gates)
- [ ] Circuit visualization (ASCII / SwiftUI)
- [ ] Noise models
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Stable public API (v1.0)

##  Final Note

**SwiftQiskit** is not just a simulator —
it’s an attempt to make **quantum computing accessible, visual, and native** on Apple platforms.

Enjoy exploring the quantum world
